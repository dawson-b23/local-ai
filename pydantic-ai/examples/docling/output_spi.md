## PURPOSE

The purpose of this standard is to provide quantitative definitions; and recommended methods of inspection and measurement of the cosmetic quality attributes in the absence of customer provided specifications;

The definitions, descriptions and classifications contained in the specification are based on typical terms used in the injection molding process and, where applicable; also relate to post molding activities.

## SCOPE

This specification addresses the cosmetic quality of molded plastic and related post molding activities parts

## DRAGMARKS

Clusters of scratches ftom plastic dragging against mold details when a part is ejected from a mold.

## FLLLINS (print or silk screen)

An excessive use of ink that alters the form of screened or printed feature. Placement of ink where no ink should be.

## The Society 0f the Plastics Industry Cosmetic Specifications of Injection Molded Parts

## GREASE

type of machine lubrication on the surface of a part. Any7

## HAZE

Cloudiness on an otherwise transparent part.

## The Society of the Plastics Industry Cosmetic Specifications of Injection Molded Parts

## INSERI PROBLEMS (Not a true "cosmetic" defect. More functional than cosmetic)

Errors related to the installation of inserts into plastic parts.   Inserts can be set too high or too low in a socket or boss. can also be damaged or misaligned and may even be missing. They

See splay.

LINI (paint)

unintended foreign substance in the coating or on the surface. Any

## MARBLING

Colored streaks caused by incomplete mixing  of 2 different colored plastics. Also referred to as streaking.

## NICKS

Like gouges but of short length. Cause by impact rather than abrasion

NON ADHESION (painted or decorated))

Lack of adequate sticking of paint; or any coating to the plastic surface. print

## ORANGE PEEL

Rippled or mottled appearance view able as concentric lines. Caused by underpressurizing. Orange is often the first sign of possible sink or shorting: peel

## The Society of the Plastics Industry Cosmetic Specifications of Injection Molded Parts

## PIN PUSH

Protrusion or distortion caused by an ejector pin pushing into part more than normal.  The protrusion is most evident on the surface opposite the ejector pin:

## PITTING

Crater-like imperfections on the surface of the part.

## PULLING

Part distortion caused from plastic catching in the mold when the part is ejected.

## RUNS (painting or printing)

Dripping or sagging of paint or ink. Movement of ink beyond intended surfaces. Usually caused by too much or too thick Or ink paint

Surface imperfection due to abrasion that removes small amounts of material. Depth is not measurable Differs from scratch in mold which leaves a consistent mark.

## SHNNE

Glossy or areas on textured surface. Usually caused by a dirty or worn mold. Can also be caused by lack of sufficient pressure to properly replicate texture in the mold. shiny

## The Society of the Plastics Industry Cosmetic Specifications of Injection Molded Parts

Missing plastic due to incomplete filling of the mold cavity. Parts are not completely formed. Can usually be identified by smooth, shiny and rounded surfaces .

## SNNK

Surface depression caused by non uniform material   solidification and   shrinkage Most  often noted at  interface between differing wall thicknesses.

## SMEARING (paint or ink)

Similar to bleeding. Excess ink or in areas that should be free of ink or paint. Smearing is due to rubbing of surface before adequately dried. paint

## SPECKS

Small discolored points of matter embedded in the surface. Typically black; caused by material contamination or material degradation.

## SPLAY

Off colored streaking. Usually appears silver-like Splay is caused by moisture in the material or thermal degradation of the resin during processing: A similar look can be caused by cold material skipping across the surface during a fast filL. This is commonly called "jetting" -

## WELDLINES

Witness line where 2 or more fionts of molten  plastic converge. Also called knitlines or flowlines .

## III STANDARD VEWING CONDITION

All quality decisions of cosmetic acceptability  will be made under normal lighting conditions (80-120 footcandles) in white fluorescent light.

## B. VEWING ANGLE

All viewing will take place with direct overhead lighting. Viewing angle is dependent on surface classification.

In every case; parts will be held such that the light is NQI REFLECTED directly to the viewer.

"A" surface Hold part 300 from the horizontal plane. Part is in direct line with your eyes.

ROTAIE part to the right and to the left about the vertical

axis. 300

"B" surface

Hold part 900 from the horizontal plane Part is in direct line with your eyes. DO NOT rotate the part.

"C" surface

Hold part 900 from the horizontal plane. Part is NOI in direct line with your eyes. Part is held 450 below the plane of your eyes. DO NOT rotate the part.

Decisions regarding color matching are made by comparison to known standards using a spectrophotometer, color meter or suitable color matching light booth customer color standard, standards shall be developed based upon the material manufacturer's color chip set and tolerances shall be set using a Delta E (AE) limit of 1.00, unless otherwise stated by the customer, supplied

## V. GLOSS.

Determination of gloss is to be made using a suitable glossmeter (e.g: BYK Gardener Glossgard 60" glossmeter) When gloss cannot be measured by glossmeter; judgement shall be made by eye against gloss standards provided by or approved by the customer. All evaluations by eye shall be under standard viewing conditions

## The Society of the Plastics Industry Cosmetic Specifications of Injection Molded Parts

Judgement as to the conformance of surface finish is to be made by comparing a part to an SPI Mold Finish Guide plaque. Comparison is by eye unless otherwise specified by the customer.

Judgement as to the conformance of surface texture is to be made by comparing a part to a Mold-Tech texture plaque. Comparison is by eye unless otherwise specified by the customer .

## VII. ADHESION

Adhesion requirements pertain to printed, painted or other decorative finishes to the surface of a plastic part. applied

The applied finish must withstand a tape test, whereby a piece of pressure sensitive tape (Scotch Number 610 Or equivalent   adhesive   strength)   is across the finished surface. The tape is then removed by rapidly pulling the tape at a 90 degree angle to the part surface: The tape is examined for evidence of finish coat removal. There should be no evidence of finish coat on the tape. applied
